      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Justin Hartsink and i am a Jr. Front End Developer. <br />
        After ten+ years of sales functions i decided to change my career and do
        something i love : create amazing websites & webapps. <br />
        In February i started with a ten week full stack webdeveloper course
        <a class="link" href="https://www.bit-academy.nl/">@bitacadmy</a> after
        succesfully finishing this course i decided it was time for the next
        step : <a class="link" href="https://techgrounds.nl/">Techgrounds</a>
        <br />
        After a three day assesement i was lucky enough to be enrolled for the
        six month course which started in May 2021. <br />
        I have a few key words that describe me as a person : <br />
        <span class="hl1">
          • Dedicated. <br />
          • Honest. <br />
          • Open minded. <br />
          • Enthusiastic <br />
        </span>
        And one thing i can't possibly describe in one word is
        <span class="hl"> I love to learn </span> new things as much and as
        often as possible. <br />
        A few quotes i live by : <br />

        <span class="hl2">
          • "There is no failure except in no longer trying." <br />
          • "Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to
          acquire it." <br />
          • "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in
          rising every time we fall." <br />
          • "When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on."
